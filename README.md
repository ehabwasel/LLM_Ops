## 📝 Overview  
This project focused on operationalizing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using industry tools and best practices. The goal was to build and deploy a custom Python coding Q&A chatbot by fine-tuning an LLM with supervised instruction tuning.  

---

## 🔑 Key Topics Covered  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Transforming raw data for LLM fine-tuning.  
- **Model Versioning**: Tracking experiments with datasets and tuned models.  
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Adapting Kubeflow Pipelines for training/deployment.  
- **Safety Monitoring**: Evaluating LLM outputs with safety scores.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Leveraging Google Cloud for scalable workflows.

## 🚀 Sample Project: Python Q&A Chatbot  
A custom LLM fine-tuned to answer Python coding questions.  

### Pipeline Steps:  
1. **Data Retrieval**: Extract Python-related QA pairs.  
2. **Instruction Tuning**: Fine-tune the LLM with supervised data.  
3. **Safety Filtering**: Score outputs to filter harmful responses.  
4. **Deployment**: Serve the model via Google Cloud endpoints.
